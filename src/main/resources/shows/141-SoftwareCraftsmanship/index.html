            <section>Agile revolution changed processes, shortened feedback loop, encouraged collaboration between developers and business.</section>
            <section>Agile hangover: after a few years of adopting agile companies realized, that the quality of software is still low.</section>
            <section>There's one extremely important thing missing: "tech", "tech"nology, "tech"nical skills, "tech"niques.</section>

            Software craftsmanship is about being a professional:
            <section>taking responsibility for everything we do,</section>
            <section>being passionate about what we do, it's not <i>just</i> a job</section>
            <section>taking care about applications, not merely delivering them,</section>
            <section>constantly learning to be able to solve problems using best techniques and tools (katas, pet projects, books, meetups, XP),</section>
            <section>teaching others, helping them become better developers,</section>
            <section>we're being perceived as experts and we should behave like ones (by saying "no" if necessary),</section>
            <section>not only code, but also business collaboration, DevOps, testing, documentation, good estimations, interviews, driving topics, /etc.,</section>
            <section>being proud of your work.</section>
        </section>

			Some history
			<section>Craftsmanship originates from mid XIV century</section>
			<section>Craftsmen joined together to form craft guilds</section>
			<section>You couldn't do your craft, unless you were a member of a guild</section>
			<section>
				To become a member of a guild, one had to go through 3 stages:
				<div data-fragment-index="0" class="fragment">apprentice - lasted 5-9 years, not paid</div>
				<div data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">journeyman - learnt his skill, being paid, but not master yet</div>
				<div data-fragment-index="2" class="fragment">master - presented his "masterpiece" built in free time and was accepted</div>

			Software craftsmanship manifesto
			<section>It's an extension to agile manifesto</section>
			<section>
				Agile: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
				<div data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">Craftsmen: Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals</div>
				<div data-fragment-index="2" class="fragment">Meetups, software conferences, go out, learn and teach, discuss</div>
			</section>
			<section>
				Agile: Working software over comprehensive documentation
				<div data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">Craftsmen: Not only working software, but also well-crafted software</div>
				<div data-fragment-index="2" class="fragment">Create maintainable software, something that we will be able easily extend and change in the future.</div>
                <div data-fragment-index="3" class="fragment">Remember: always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</div>

			<section>
				Agile: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
				<div data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">Craftsmen: Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships</div>

                Agile: Responding to change over following a plan
                <div data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">Craftsmen: Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value</div>
                <div data-fragment-index="2" class="fragment">Be proactive, automate adding new FCs or add all countries to logistics interface before it would hurt you again</div>
            </section>
            <section>
                Agile (proposal by Uncle Bob): Craftsmanship over crap (craftsmanship over execution)
                <div data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">Most software development teams execute, but they donâ€™t take care. We value execution, but we value craftsmanship more.</div>
            </section>

		<section>
			Why all that?<br/>Some obvious truths:
			<section>In the whole software lifecycle most costs goes to maintenance, not development. In total it's cheaper to spend more time and money in the beginning, but do things right.</section>
			<section>Taking shortcuts makes us slower in the long run. Design system properly, keep quality high and any change will be fast and easy to do.</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			Software development is engineering? Craft? Art?
			<section>Why not all of above?</section>
			<section>Why can't we compare software development to architecture?<br/></section>
			<section>Design?<br/><img src="design1.jpg" style="max-width: 50%;border: 0"/></section>
			<section>Elegant code cannot be improved by refactoring anything. It makes you happy to look at it. You are proud of it.</section>
