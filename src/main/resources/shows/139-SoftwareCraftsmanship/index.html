			Some history
			<section>Craftsmanship originates from mid XIV century</section>
			<section>Craftsmen joined together to form craft guilds</section>
			<section>You couldn't do your craft, unless you were a member of a guild</section>
			<section>
				To become a member of a guild, one had to go through 3 stages:
				<div data-fragment-index="0" class="fragment">apprentice - lasted 5-9 years, not paid</div>

				<div data-fragment-index="2" class="fragment">master - presented his "masterpiece" built in free time and was accepted</div>
