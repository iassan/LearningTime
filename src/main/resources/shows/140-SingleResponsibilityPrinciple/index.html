		<section>Single responsibility principle aka SRP</section>
		<section>&quot;The SRP is one of the simplest of the principle,<br/>and one of the hardest to get right.&quot;<br/></section>
		<section>There are two parts of that principle:</section>
		<section>
			A class should have a responsibility over only a single concept<br/><br/>
			<div data-fragment-index="0" class="fragment">AND<br/><br/></div>
			<div data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.</div>
		</section>
		<section>In other words:<br/><br/><div data-fragment-index="0" class="fragment">There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.</div></section>
		<section>SRP is derived from and closely related to cohesion - a measure of how close two or more concepts belong together.</section>
		<section>High cohesion also leads to loose coupling, because only very close concepts are kept together, everything else is separated.</section>
		<section>Why?</section>
		<section>Suppose we have a class that is responsible for two concepts, say, preparing a report and formatting it into HTML.</section>
		<section>
			When we need to change one of those concepts, for whatever reason,
			<section>then:</section>
			<section>we have a more complicated problem to solve, because we need to touch one concept and leave the other untouched (higher estimation)</section>
			<section>we are more likely to accidentally break the other concept (system fragility)</section>
			<section>we would need to adapt more tests, because each one is touching both of those concepts (higher estimation, fragile tests)</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			The same applies to the tests:<br/>one test == exactly one behaviour.<br/><br/>
			<section>Otherwise:</section>
			<section>one bug can make many tests red â†’ where's the bug?</section>
			<section>change to one behaviour forces us to touch many tests</section>
			<section>verifying the same thing many times doesn't bring any value, because this behaviour is covered by some other test (DRY)</section>
		</section>
		<section>How this relates to OWQ?</section>
		<section>
			OrderReleaser
			<section>Concept: this unit is only responsible for releasing orders from OWQ to next order processing chain job, yet...</section>
			<section>
				knows why the orders are being released:<br/>
				<pre><code data-trim>public void releaseNeverQueuedOrder(OrderIdDto orderIdDto) {
  updateJobStateAndTrackReleaseTime(orderIdDto);
  orderAuditingTracker.trackOrderReleased(orderIdDto,
      "order immediately released due to no matching queue");
}</code></pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				knows which tracker to call:<br/>
				<pre><code data-trim>public void releaseOrder(OrderIdDto orderIdDto) {
  updateJobStateAndTrackReleaseTime(orderIdDto);
  orderAuditingTracker.trackOrderReleased(orderIdDto, "");
}

private void updateJobStateAndTrackReleaseTime(
                OrderIdDto orderIdDto) {
  updateJobState(orderIdDto);
  orderHistoryTracker.trackOrderReleased(orderIdDto);
}</code></pre>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			Dequeuer
			<section>Concept: this unit is only responsible for removing orders from queues, yet...</section>
			<section>
				manages transactions:<br/>
				<pre><code data-trim>@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.MANDATORY)
public void dequeue(OrderIdDto orderIdDto,
    QueueIdDto queueIdDto, Reason reason) {</code></pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				knows reasons, why orders are being dequeued:<br/>
				<pre><code>public enum Reason {
  MAXIMUM_QUEUE_TIME_EXCEEDED("maximum queueing time exceeded"),
  QUEUE_EXPIRED("queue expired"),
  QUEUE_BLOCKING_TIME_ENDED("queue blocking time ended"),
  ORDER_SPILLED_OVER_FROM_QUEUE("order spilled over from queue"),
  DEQUEUED_WITH_OWQ_ADMIN(
    "order has been dequeued with the OWQ admin web application");
}</code></pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				knows which tracker to call:<br/>
				<pre><code>public boolean dequeueIfEnqueued(OrderIdDto orderIdDto) {
  QueuedOrder queuedOrder = queuedOrderRepository.findByOrderId(
      orderIdDto);
  if (queuedOrder != null) {
    QueueIdDto queueIdDto = new QueueIdDto(
        queuedOrder.getQueueId());
    queuedOrderRepository.delete(queuedOrder);
    orderQueueHistoryTracker.trackOrderDequeued(orderIdDto,
        queueIdDto);
    orderAuditingTracker.trackOrderDequeued(orderIdDto,
        queueIdDto,
        Reason.MAXIMUM_QUEUE_TIME_EXCEEDED.getComment());
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}</code></pre>

		<section>But fear not, we can still fix all that!</section>
